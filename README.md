## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: I utilized Axios to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring reliable and efficient data retrieval.
- **Open Weather API**: Provides weather data, including current weather, forecasts, and historical data.
- **Context API**: For state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Date-fns**: For formatting dates.

## Approach

The application is structured with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Individual components are responsible for rendering specific parts of the UI.
- **Context API**: Used for managing global state, such as the current weather data and loading states.
- **API Integration**: The application fetches weather data from the Open Weather API using async/await syntax within useEffect hooks for lifecycle management.


## Known Issues or Limitations

- **Geolocation Permissions**: If the user denies geolocation permissions, the application defaults to a predefined location. Future improvements could include a more user-friendly way to handle this scenario.
- **API Rate Limiting**: The Open Weather API has rate limiting. Exceeding the limit may result in temporary unavailability of weather data. Consider upgrading to a higher API plan if necessary.
